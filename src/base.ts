// once we do that we can clean the code a little with the `xdr.HashIdPreimage.envelopeTypeSorobanAuthorization` stuff
// ... note I've re-read the above and I've currently got no clue what this is asking for. Maybe check git-blame for when it was added to try and find some context
// actually this is just talking about adding support for signing transactions with an ed25519 key as well as a passkey. Simple enough
